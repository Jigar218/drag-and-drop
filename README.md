Drag-and-Drop Website Builder 
•	This is a simple website builder built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to add elements like text, images, and buttons onto a canvas.
•	Users can drag and drop elements on desktop, while mobile users can tap buttons to add elements. Once placed, elements can be edited through a form panel where users can change text, font size, colors, or image URLs. 
•	The project showcases dynamic DOM manipulation, responsive design consideration, and basic UI editing tools — all without using external libraries or frameworks.
